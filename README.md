# Puzzles-PolygonSquare

Find all squares when given a set of (x,y) coordinates.

## Background

This is a geometry lesson task.

It uses the arctan of points in relation to an average centroid point
to sort points in one direction, clockwise or counter, around the
perimeter of the polygon.

It uses the difference of squares to find the distance between points.
This functions as a check to see all side are the same length.

It uses the dot product to check that the corner of all the edges
are orthogonal, or 90 degree angles.
